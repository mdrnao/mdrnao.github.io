## Error handling and validation

### File import

This is a reactive function, which requires an input data file to be uploaded.

`tools::file_ext(input$filedata$name)` is used to determine the extension of the file which is uploaded. This is then passed to a `switch` function, which evaluates the expression and accordingly chooses which of the arguments to execute (in our case how the file is read). The `validate` function will display an error message of our choosing if an error is tripped. This is useful since R error messages are typically confusing for a non-coder.

> `userdata <- reactive({`
>
> `req(input$filedata)`
>
> `ext <- tools::file_ext(input$filedata$name)`
>
> `switch(ext,`
>
> `csv = read.csv(input$filedata$datapath),`
>
> `tsv = read.delim(input$filedata$datapath),`
>
> `validate("Invalid file; Please upload a .csv or .tsv file") )  })`
