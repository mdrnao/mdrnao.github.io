I set `separate_names = T` then collected the full author name from the list-data using `bib$author = unlist(lapply(bib$AUTHOR, function(x) paste(unlist(x[\"full_name\"]), collapse = \",  \")))` so that the names are formatted how I wanted.\n\nI wanted my name to be highlighted so I made it bold. To do this, I used `gsub` to add bold syntax around my name only: `<strong> name </strong>`. This also worked with the markdown standard `** name **`.\n\nI sorted all the table in order of publication, then created three different tables for my publication groups (published, preprints, in prep). Each followed the same format: filter, select the right columns, paste the right syntax. I used glue [@glue] to create the right html format.\n\n-   `<p\\> text </p>` is html to indicate a new paragraph?\n-   `{column title}` to use a variable/column from the df\n-   `<a href={URL} target='\\_blank'>{TITLE} </a>` for the title of the paper\n    -   `<a>` is html for a link\n    -   `href` to give it the site pointer\n    -   `target` specifies where to open the linked document\n\nTook me forever to work out I needed to use `glue_collapse` afterwards, otherwise I ended up with rogue commas on new lines.\n\n## Need to have a think how to transfer this to pdf \n\n-   Separate names flag will make it easier to exract just the first initial from the first name. This will compress some of the author lists.\n\nBut that is for another eve...\n",
