R is my safe space. So, when asked in a panic for a nicely formatted CV by my husband, I naturally turned to R. After some frantic googling (I only had a day!) I found some amazing templates and successfully hacked something together. However, I realised that whilst I understood enough TeX/html/css to successfully make a CV, I couldn't quite do everything I wanted. 

One thing which really bugged me was the citation formatting. Whilst I need to start learning latex formatting properly to get it working for a pdf, I could do it in R.

## Making the references bibtex file

Here I was pretty lazy and utilised Quarto's fantastic citation tool to create a nicely formatted bibtex file.

-   Click on insert whilst using Rstudio's visual editor - this will bring up a pop up with multiple options.
-   Click on the left hand side panel on pubmed - I then searched my name and found my existing publications and added them using the little plus button
-   For my preprints - these are on research square so I searched the DOI
-   I then clicked insert
-   I navigated to the newly created references.bib file and opened it up
-   I changed the preprints from "\@misc" to my own "\@prepr"
-   I then created entries for my papers I'm writing at the moment - copy and paste one before (only need authors, title, year)[@glue]

This page will work with any bibtex file, manual or otherwise!

## Formatting the data in R

I used a mixture of dplyr [@dplyr] for its piping and bib2df [@bib2df] because it creates a wonderful dataframe. I set `separate_names = T` then collected the full author name from the list-data using `bib$author = unlist(lapply(bib$AUTHOR, function(x) paste(unlist(x["full_name"]), collapse = ",  ")))` so that the names are formatted how I wanted.

I wanted my name to be highlighted so I made it bold. To do this, I used `gsub` to add bold syntax around my name only: `<strong> name </strong>`. This also worked with the markdown standard `** name **`.

I sorted all the table in order of publication, then created three different tables for my publication groups (published, preprints, in prep). Each followed the same format: filter, select the right columns, paste the right syntax. I used glue [@glue] to create the right html format.

-   `<p\> text </p>` is html to indicate a new paragraph?
-   `{column title}` to use a variable/column from the df
-   `<a href={URL} target='\_blank'>{TITLE} </a>` for the title of the paper
    -   `<a>` is html for a link
    -   `href` to give it the site pointer
    -   `target` specifies where to open the linked document

Took me forever to work out I needed to use `glue_collapse` afterwards, otherwise I ended up with rogue commas on new lines.

## Need to have a think how to transfer this to pdf

-   Separate names flag will make it easier to exract just the first initial from the first name. This will help to compress some of the author lists.

But that is for another eve...
