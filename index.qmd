I'm Holly, a post-doc at [CRUK Beatson Institute](https://www.beatson.gla.ac.uk) in [Prof Crispin Miller's](https://www.beatson.gla.ac.uk/beatson-research/beatson-research-groups/crispin-miller-computational-biology.html) group.

I'm attempting to learn how to properly use [Quarto](https://quarto.org), especially lua, HTML, and CSS. They say the best way to learn is doing... so here's my attempt at doing. A blog may appear to pretend I'm teaching - let's see if I get that far!
